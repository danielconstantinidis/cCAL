Calculator
Use -h for help

Instructions
============

- This program is a command line based calculator 
- You can add, subtract, multiply and divide. 
- The program is bsed on a loop that is designed to read user input for a number and a symbol.
 
On the first walkthrough:
- The sum will be initialized based on user input for the first unkown variable.
- This is when the sum is initialized.

 The rest of the time  
- Symbols will indicate the equation type run in the the loop.
- Finally a second number is entered which will alter the sum based on the equation requested
- The sum will be outputted everytime an equation is entered.
- To exit enter '=' for the symbol input, prompt for an additional number will be ignored. 
- Additionally, to ask for help again you must launch the program again until I fix it.
