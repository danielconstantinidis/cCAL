Instructions
============
- This program is a command-line based calculator written in C
- You can add, subtract, multiply and divide.
- The program is based on a loop that is designed to read user input for a number and a symbol.
            
 On the first walk through: 
- The sum will be initialized based on user input for the first unknown variable.
- This is when the sum is initialized.
 
 The rest of the time: 
- Symbols will indicate the equation type run in the loop.
- Finally a second number is entered which will alter the sum based on the equation requested
- The sum will be outputted every time an equation is entered.
- To exit enter = for the symbol, prompt for a second numeric variable will be ignored.
- Additionally, to ask for help again you must launch the program again until I fix it.
